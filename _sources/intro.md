# ASTROBIOLOGY 200

**By KC and ED**

This book contains the topics covered in **Astrobiology 200** at [The University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html).  The book is broadly divided in four parts:

- **PART I: THE CONTEXT FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE.**
- **PART II: LIFE ON EARTH.**
- **PART III: LIFE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.**
- **PART IV: LIFE AMONGST THE STARS.**

**Astrobiology 200** is a stage 2 paper in the [School of Environment](http://www.env.auckland.ac.nz/en.html). The course assumes no background in the sciences, therefore it is designed for anyone interested in *Astrobiology* with high-school level education.

# Textbook and Literature for The Course

The main book of the course is the 4th edition of ***Life in the Universe*** by Jeffrey Bennett and Seth Shostak. Special readings will be assigned on relevant content as the course progresses.

# About this Book

This book was created using the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html) template. A few features of this book are:

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.
* It is in the form of a website based on Jekyll and hosted for free on GitHub. 
* You can use Python code.  Some pages have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
