Biology's Jewel: The Double Helix
====================

The word DNA is in common usage for us today as their role in the make up of genes.  That was not 
the case at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.  That DNA is the carrier of genetic information
and its peculiar structure is a scientific achievement of the post-war period after 1945.  In other 
words, nobody knew that genes were entirely composed of DNA by the time of the Second World War.

The story of how we know the famous structure involves the seminar lectures of an inspiring physicist, 
methods from crystallography, and the insightful minds of several scientists, among them the one of a 
brilliant experimental scientist called *Rosalind Franklin*.

## The Bright Lady of DNA 

She took excellent X-ray diffraction patterns, thanks to her careful experimental preparation procedures
to generate a crystal out of DNA.

The title of this section is inspired by the nickname James Watson and Maurice Wilkins gave to 
Rosalind Franklin, since they referred to her as the 'dark lady'.
