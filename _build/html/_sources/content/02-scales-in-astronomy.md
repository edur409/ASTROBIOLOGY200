# Scales in Astronomy

Something about the huge scales of the Universe and how we get toknow them.

## The Use of Parallax

The parallax and its use to estimate distances relies in one of the most practical equations in Euclidean geometry: [The Law of Sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines). The equation applies to triangles and, coincidentally enough, it depends on just three pieces of information. How's that?

Any triangle can be defined completely by knowing the length of one of its sides and two of its internal angles, or, by knowing the length of two sides and one of its internal angles.

This is quite practical in surveying and astronomy where we know very well the distance between two corners of the triangle and we measure the angles to the remaining corner from the previous locations. Applying the Law of Sines to measure distances is usually referred to as triangulation.

## Beyond the limits of Parallax: Leavitt's Law

So far we have covered how distances to an object can be calculated by measuring angles to that object from two different points of view of known distance of separation (triangulation).  The farther the objects, the larger the distance needed between those known points of view so we have enough precision in our angular measurements. Our Universe is so vast, that from our perspective and available points of view, it becomes unmeasurable by the parallax method. 

The researcher that found a way to circunvent this problem was [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrwq_-pKd2Q) in the early 20th century.  Leavitt was a very much underpaid female astronomer, like all female astronomers of her time, working at the **Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College**.  She was employed, like the women at that time, just to catalogue hundreds of astronomical observations preserved as tiny dots on the surface of delicate photosensitive glass plates used in the telescopes.  Their work was tedious but methodical and they were given the chance to do it since it was a boring, painstaking, but of crucial importance. These women were known as the **Harvard Computers**.

Leavitt studied one type of stars known as Cepheid Variables.  These stars changed brightness in her glass plates collected at different times, she noticed they seem to be pulsating.  The genius of Leavitt went beyong by recognising there was a relationship between the brightness of the stars and their period of pulsation or beat. The horizontal axis in the graph below is the logarithm of the period of the corresponding Cepheid in days, and the vertical axis is its magnitude. That graph was made published by Leavitt in 1912 as a report on 25 Cepheids she had observed in the [*Small Magellanic Cloud*](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Small+Magellanic+Cloud). The thick straight lines drawn connect points corresponding to the stars' minimum and maximum brightness, respectively.

> ''Since the variables are probably at nearly the same distance from the Earth, their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light''

### Importance of the discovery

Imagine you are on a hill at night looking into the city.  Each lightbulb in the distance looks like a star in the sky emiting light depending on their power.  Now imagine that you notice some special pulsating lightbulbs among that vast constellation of points and that these lightbulbs have a peculiarity: the brighter they are, the slower they blink (have longer periods).  What Leavitt found is that if two of these lightbulbs blink at the same rate, they emit the same intensity of light (have same brightness), so any changes in how their dimming light reaches our eyes is related to their distance.  She found a way of estimating relative distance to stars from the intensity of their light alone.
