    "# RNA World Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA is a simpler cousin of DNA.  As you may know, RNA is widely thought to be the first self replicating life-form to arise perhaps around 4 billion years ago. One of the strongest arguments for this theory is that RNA is able to carry information in its nucleotides like DNA, and like protein, it is able to adopt higher order structures to catalyze reactions, such as self replication. So it is likely, and there is growing evidence that this is the case, that the first form of replicating life was RNA. And because of this dual property of RNA as a hereditary information vessel as well as a structural/functional element we can use RNA molecules to build very nice population models. \n",

    "## Population Evolution in *an* RNA World\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study the evolution of a population, we first need a model of a population. And even before that, we need to define what we mean by *population*. Populations can be defined on many levels and with many diffferent criteria. For our purposes, we will simply say that a population is a set of individuals sharing a common environment. And because this is population *genetics* we can think of individuals as entities comprising of specific genes or chromosomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So where do we get a population from? As you may have discussed in previous workshops, there are very large datasets containing sequencing information from different populations. So we could download one of these datasets and perform some analysis on it. But I find this can be dry and tedious. So why download data when we can simply create our own?\n",

    "In this section we're going to be creating and studying our own \"artificial\" populations to illustrate some important population genetics concepts and methodologies. Not only will this help you learn population genetics, but you will get a lot more programming practice than if we were to simply parse data files and go from there. \n",

This is analogous to what is known in evolutionary terms as a genotype and a phenotype. With these properties, we have everything we need to model a population, and simulate its evolution.\n",

The corresponding phenotype $\\omega$ is the secondary structure of $s$ which can be thought of as a pairing between nucleotides in the primary sequence that give rise to a 2D architecture. Because it has been shown that the function of many biomolecules, including RNA, is driven by structure this gives us a good proxy for phenotype. \n",

Another thing to notice is that, although in reality this is often not the case, in general we only allow pairs between $\\{C,G\\}$ and $\\{A, U\\}$ nucleotides, most modern approaches allow for non-canonical pairings and you will find some examples of this in the above structure.\n",

Because bonds tend to stabilize RNA, the algorithm tries to maximize the number of pairs in the structure and return that as its solution. Current approaches achieve more accurate solutions by using energy models based one experimental values to then obtain a structure that minimizes free energy. But since we're not really concerned with the accuracy of our predictions, Nussinov is a good entry point. Furthermore, the main algorithmic concepts are the same between Nussinov and state of the art RNA structure prediction algorithms. I implemented the algorithm in a separate file called `fold.py` that we can import and use its functions. I'm not going to go into detail here on how the algorithm works because it is beyond the scope of this workshop but there is a bonus exercise at the end if you're curious.\n",

    "### Fitness of a sequence: Target Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a good way of getting a phenotype (secondary structure), we need a way to evaluate the fitness of that phenotype. If we think in real life terms, fitness is the ability of a genotype to replicate into the next generation. If you have a gene carrying a mutation that causes some kind of disease, your fitness is decreased and you have a lower chance of contributing offspring to the next generation. On a molecular level the same concept applies. A molecule needs to accomplish a certain function, i.e. bind to some other molecule or send some kind of signal. And as we've seen before, the most important factor that determines how well it can carry out this function is its structure. So we can imagine that a certain structure, we can call this a 'target' structure, is required in order to accomplish a certain function. So a sequence that folds correctly to a target structure is seen as having a greater fitness than one that does not. Since we've encoded structures as simple dot-bracket strings, we can easily compare structures and thus evaluate the fitness between a given structure and the target, or 'correct' structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to compare structures $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$, but we're going to use one of the simplest ways, which is base-pair distance. This is just the number of pairs in $w_{1}$ that are not in $w_{2}$. Again, this is beyond the scope of this workshop so I'll just give you the code for it and if you would like to know more you can ask me."

    "## The Fitness of a Cell \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are able to create populations of cells, we need a way of asssessing their individual fitness.  In our model, a *Cell* is an object that contains two sequences of RNA, something analogous to having two copies of a gene in each chromosome.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply loop through each *Cell* in the population and check the base pair distance to the target structure we defined.  However, this approach of using base-pair distance is not the best for defining fitness. There are two reasons for this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want fitness to represent a *probability* that a cell will reproduce (pass its genes to the next generation), and base pair distance is, in our case, an integer value.\n",
    "2. We want this probability to be a *relative* measure of fitness. That is, we want the fitness to be proportional to how good a cell is with respect to all others in the population. This touches on an important principle in evolution where we only need to be 'better' than the rest of the population (the competition) and not good in some absolute measure. For instance, if you and I are being chased by a predator. In order to survive, I only need to be faster than you, and not necessarily some absolute level of fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a probability (number between 0 and 1) we use the following equation to define the fitness of a structure $\\omega$ on a target structure $T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\omega, T) = N^{-1} exp(\\frac{-\\beta \\texttt{dist}(\\omega, T)}{\\texttt{len}(\\omega)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N = \\sum_{i \\in Pop}{P(\\omega_i, T})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the $N$ is what gives us the 'relative' measure because we divide the fitness of the Cell by the sum of the fitness of every other Cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick look at how this function behaves if we plot different base pair distance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the effect of the parameter $\\beta$? Try plotting the same function but with different values of $\\beta$."

    "## Introducing diversity: Mutations\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution would go nowhere without random mutations. While mutations are technically just random errors in the copying of genetic material, they are essential in the process of evolution. This is because they introduce novel diversity to populatons, which with a low frequency can be beneficial. And when a beneficial mutation arises (i.e. a mutation that increases fitness, or replication probability) it quickly takes over the population and the populatioin as a whole has a higher fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing mutations in our model will be quite straightforward. Since mutations happen at the genotype/sequence level, we simply have to iterate through our strings of nucleotides (sequences) and randomly introduce changes."

Once you have populations with a diverse range of fitnesses, we need to select the fittest individuals and let them replicate and contribute offspring to the next generation.

Once we have sampled enough Cells to build our next generation, we introduce mutations and compute the fitness values of the new generation."

    "The populations we generated evolved asexually. This means that individuals do not mate or exchange genetic information. So to make our simulation a bit more interesting let's let the Cells mate. This is going to require a few small changes in the `selection()` function. Previously, when we selected sequences to go into the next generation we just let them provide one offspring which was a copy of itself and introduced mutations. Now instead of choosing one Cell at a time, we will randomly choose two 'parents' that will mate. When they mate, each parent will contribute one of its chromosomes to the child. We'll repeat this process until we have filled the next generation."
